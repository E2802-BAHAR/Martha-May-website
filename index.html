        <h2>About the photographers</h2>
        <p>We are wedding photographers based in Hereford, UK and we have photographed over 300 weddings now. If you think about it, roughly there is about 10 (8-12) group images per wedding. That’s why we can say we have taken over 3000 wedding group photos
            so far.If you think about the number of wedding photos delivered in total, roughly 800 per wedding, that will be well over 240 000 photos.And we usually take about 5000 photos at a wedding – so that’s over one and a half million photos taken.
            That’s quite a good experience.</p>

            <h2>Wedding photos are memories</h2>
            <p>Your wedding photos are so important – they will hold you memories and they will be the one thing you will have left once your wedding day is gone. That’s why choosing the right wedding photographer for you is so important, the photographer
                that fits YOUR style and personality.Engaged couples are a lot more interested in creative wedding photography right now. They want something that really captures their true nature and that’s why the term ‘FORMAL WEDDING PICTURES’, ‘GROUP
                SHOTS’ or ‘GROUP WEDDING PHOTOS’ sounds too traditional.No matter how original the wedding is, every bride and groom will still want wedding group photos. If you think about it, how many opportunities do you actually get to have EVERYONE
                you love around you on one day? </p>

        <h2>Formal group pictures – the comments</h2>
        <p>The long lists of formal pictures are rather impractical so I’ve done some research and I’ve gathered some amazing thoughts on the group shots. This is exactly the type of the wedding group photos I’ve always tried to achieve. Big thanks to our
            awesome couples for giving us their feedback! ”I didn’t actually want any group shots because I prefer the more natural photographs, however, I’m so glad you convinced me otherwise. And even your ‘posed’ photographs look completely natural.
